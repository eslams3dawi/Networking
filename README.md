# Networking – Subnetting, VLSM & Static Routing

This repository contains practical networking labs and projects implemented using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, focusing on **Subnetting**, **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)**, and **Static Routing**.  
All scenarios were implemented as part of hands-on training and a practical networking exam.

## 🧠 What I Implemented

### 🔹 Subnetting
- Designed multiple network topologies including:
  - Two subnets network
  - Multiple subnets using different network modules
  - Advanced subnetting with three subnets
- Performed full subnetting calculations:
  - Network Address
  - Broadcast Address
  - Valid Host Range
  - Subnet Mask
- Configured:
  - IP addressing for PCs
  - Router interfaces
- Verified connectivity using **ping**.
- Added PNG screenshots for clear visualization of each topology.

### 🔹 VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)
- Implemented VLSM to optimize IP address allocation.
- Designed networks with:
  - Different subnet sizes based on host requirements
- Assigned:
  - Correct subnet masks for each subnet
  - Valid IP ranges without wasting addresses
- Ensured full connectivity between all subnets.

---

### 🔹 Static Routing
- Configured **static routing** between routers using:
  - `ip route` commands
- Enabled communication between different LANs.
- Tested routing paths to ensure:
  - End-to-end connectivity
  - No unreachable networks or routing loops.

---

### 🔹 Practical Exam Solution
- Full solution for a **Networking Practical Exam**, including:
  - Network design
  - Subnetting and VLSM
  - Router configurations
  - Static routing
- Provided:
  - Complete `.pkt` solution files
  - Step-by-step screenshots showing:
    - Network topology
    - Router configuration commands
- All exam requirements were successfully implemented and tested.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open any `.pkt` file using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Review IP addressing and router configurations.
3. Use `ping` and `tracert` to test network connectivity.
4. Refer to PNG screenshots for topology and configuration guidance.
